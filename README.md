## Project 1
Campus air pollution and student sports injuries

### Abstract
Multiple studies have shown that factors such as temperature and air pollution can affect people's cognitive level and a series of effects. Some related reports include air pollution and cognition, air pollution and traffic accidents, etc. All show that air pollution does not only affect people's respiratory system. Therefore, this study investigated whether atmospheric temperature and air pollution are related to the number of injuries among students in school.

### Brief Conclusion
Surveying Macau's atmospheric data and on-campus medical data from September 2021 to October 2023, the results show that the number of injuries among students in school is moderately correlated with temperature (p<0.05), and NO2 and CO among air pollutants are also There is a moderate correlation (p<0.05), while the correlation between rainfall, sunshine time and PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and O3 is low.
